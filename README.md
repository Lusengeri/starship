Starship is a game created using the PyGame Library. It utilizes custom 2D assets to create a compelling experience. It is inspired by the 'Starship Meteors' game described by J. Hunt in his book 'Advanced Python Programming'. This implementation builds upon the original concept to create a fuller gaming experience.
